Hello! This project is incomplete as of submission (Fri, 06/12) as I was out of town. Included is progress I made earlier in the week (Mon/Tues). I am still rewriting the code to fit with the XML, so beware! This app does not currently launch (I left myself a note indicating where/why). I will continue to work on this over the weekend.

**Quick write-up:**
* Refactored code - moved view initialization, setting of listeners to their own methods in order to clean-up onCreate().
* Removed some extraneous/redundant comments
* Started to rewrite layout XML for EditPhoto.java -- main objective of my fork. This app is robust feature-wise, but UI is cluttered and not the most straightforward in terms of usability. Still need to fill in drawables, etc.
* Added dialog boxes in order to remove clutter from editor view and make editing options more immediately accessible.
* As we were instructed not to rewrite a lot of the code, I suggested that the team look into ViewFlipper to manage vanilla/demotivation meme views. I think this would help their code in terms of removing all the visibility settings they have to make programatically.
